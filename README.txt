CREATIVE COMPONENT

(1) GENERAL COMMENTS
The first thing that came to mind when thinking of British Columbia
is its nature and wilderness. So I decided to make a campground scene
with mountains, trees, cabins, bonfire, and bear.

(2) A FEW THINGS I LEARNED WHILE WORKING ON THE CREATIVE COMPONENT
- How to scale, rotate, and move an object or geometry
- How to create a polyhedron by specifying vertices and faces
- How to add textures to geometries by using pictures
- How to load obj files and add new objects to the scene
